# Interactive Dashboard for Last Mile Logistics ðŸ“ŠðŸšš

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an interactive dashboard designed for the visualization and management of last-mile logistics data. Leveraging the dataset from the "Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge," this tool aims to enhance the efficiency, punctuality, and precision of last-mile deliveries.

## Motivation
With the exponential growth of e-commerce, last-mile logistics has become increasingly important due to its direct impact on customer satisfaction and operational costs for companies. Addressing the unique challenges in this stage, such as efficiency and accuracy, is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the market. This project employs advanced technologies like data engineering and visualization to provide valuable insights and optimize delivery routes.
